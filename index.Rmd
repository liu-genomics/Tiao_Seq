* Explore why there is a low mappability rate for reads with a Jump-Seq barcode. Use 160402 5hmc data (He-lu-6_S6_L006_R1_001). Randomly picked 10 reads, 6 reads have multiple alignments, 6 reads would have been mapped if allowing for 2 or 3 mismatches, 3 reads are not mapped even if allowing for 3 mismatches  [[More...]](./analysis/170210_investigate_low_mappability_issue.html).
