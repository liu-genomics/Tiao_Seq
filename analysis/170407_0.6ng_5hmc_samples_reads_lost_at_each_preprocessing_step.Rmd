title: "The number of reads lost at each step for 20170321 5hmc samples"
output: html_document
---

***
Look at reads lost at each step for 0.6ng 5hmc samples from different batches.
The motivation here is to compare the performance of different library prep strategies for making 5hmc library from small amount of cells
