Start to host web sites in analysis folder.

  * There has been html rendering issue since I installed newer versions of R (R3.2.0, or R3.3.2). There are two main problems: **1)** The image quality becomes much lower, i.e, images get less clear and the storage size of images become smaller if I save them. In the direct output from R, i.e., image that pops up after I run a R code that gneerates an image, has thiner lines and texts. And this thinning is very likely to cause the blurring image in the html output. **2)** Even if I set the correct paramters to output a standalone html (e.g., don't set self_contained: false), running R3.3.2 would still output a html that depends on images stored in local folders. However, if I run the same code on RCC with the same version of R, everything works just fine. 
  * Gao suggested me do the following if I want to systematically use RCC to render html files while avoid having conflicts between local folders and repo folders in Github.dsfs
    + On the local desktop, only push Rmd files to the master branch, could use .gitignore to control this
    + Then on RCC, pull master, set up the gh-pages branch, only push htmls to gh-pages
    + under this setup there won't be conflicts between local machine and RCC.
    + could write a code on RCC to automatically generate html on RCC and release html to github gh-pages
  * Some helpful commands that I will use 
    + Use `git rm --cached FILENAME` to delete it from the repository but keep the file physically and `git add FILENAME` to add a file to your repository. You will need to commit both of these changes with git commit
    + Use the above code to rm all htmls in analysis on local and push to remote, does remove all analysis/*.htmls on remote
    + edit `.gitignore` to ignore `analysis/*.html` and `index.html`
    + now will go RCC, use `git pull origin master` to pull down all updated *.Rmd files on master branch on RCC
    + on RCC master branch, run Rscript to generate htmls from updated Rmds
    + using `git checkout -b gh-pages` to generate a new gh-pages (only do this for the first time to generate this releasing branch)
    + remember to change the `.gitgnore` file in gh-pages to not ignore *.html files
    + in the RCC gh-pages branch, add index.html and analysis*.html, and commit and push to gh-pages
    + This set up will ensure there is no conflict between the operation on my local desktop and RCC. The files other than index.html and analysis/*.html on gh-pages would be freezed at the moment that the gh-pages was generated

```
git rm -r -f --cached analysis/
cd analysis/

  * Need to find active enhancer regions in mES cells. Possible candidates are
    + p300 peaks mentioned in Tab-Seq
    + Open chromatin regions mentioned in Tab-Seq
    + Other epigenomic histone marks
  * Need to use these information to plot the distribution of Jump-Seq reads. The relevant lib that I will use for plotting is `../lib/170204_mapping_reads_to_bed.R
  * Waiting Shengtong analysis results from compare peak consistency between combined replicates and compare peaks to 5hmc Seal peaks identified by Dali Han

### 170309
  * Get mouse ES cells epigenomics dataset from Gary Hon.  GSM723018 for mES P300 ChIP-Seq.  GSM723020 for INPUT, will call peaks (remove dup, qvalue 0.05, then select intersected peaks across replicates).
  * Also get `../other_annotations/epigenomic_annotation/Shen_et_al_2012_Nature_mES_cells_Enhancer_in_Table_S7.bed`, but the bed file has overlapped peaks and the sizes of the peaks are too big.
